  "description": "I love to solve problems: whether its planning and executing of technical alpine climbs or ski descents, felling hazard trees working as a Wildland Firefighter, or approaching new software engineering challenges, I thrive in the process of deriving a solution.  I have experience provisioning cloud resources, implementing CI pipelines, writing shell scripts, and building full stack web applications. With my ability to learn and adapt quickly, effectively communicate, and lead teams, Iâ€™m looking to fill the role of a Software Engineer.",
